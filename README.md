# automated-requester
A tool to accomplish some automatic HTTP requests.

## Usage
First, clone this repository
```
clone https://github.com/JeanCHilger/automated-requester.git
cd automated-requester
```
Use `./requester new <env-name>` to create new "environments" (for now not the proper word).

Inside your environment you can use `./manage <command>` to easily manage it.

* Currently only the POST method is available.
